/* When you are styling your page, my advice is that you use flexbox to style the layout of your website, and positioning for individual elements. */

/* If you want to build something similar to the SpaceY website, these are some selectors that will be userful.
background-image --> we use this one in CSS to add a background image. You can also customise the size
vh and vw --> we use the viewport height and viewport width to show the content of our website adapted to what the user can see on their screen at a time.
z-index --> if we change the z-index of an element, it will push that element to the front or the back of the screen */
