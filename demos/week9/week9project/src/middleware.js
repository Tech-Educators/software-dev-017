// Set up you middleware with the Clerk template, you don't need to write it from scratch yourself!
//The only edit you'll make to the template is the logic to make specific routes protected and other public.
// A public route is available to everyone at all times.
// A protected route is only available to a user if they are authorised to view it. You might want to protect user information? What route displays user information?
