# VSCode Extensions

There is a list of extensions in the [development guide](https://development-setup.vercel.app/web-development/vscode#vscode-extensions)

Other useful extensions are:

- **vscode-icons** _(optional)_: if you want your VSCode icons to look the same as mine.
- **Thunder Client / Postman**: we will introduce these ones on week 4.
- **VS Code ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets** _(optional)_: we can use this one from week 6 onwards.
- **Tailwind Fold** _(optional)_: this one will be useful from week 8.
- **Total TypeScript** _(optional)_: this one will be useful from week 9.
- **Docker**: we will use this one on week 11.

I do recommend you find a **VSCode theme** that works better for you. I will be using **Shades of Purple** during the course.
