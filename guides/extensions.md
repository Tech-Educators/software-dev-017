# VSCode Extensions

There is a list of extensions in the [development guide](https://development-setup.vercel.app/web-development/vscode#vscode-extensions)

Other useful extensions are:

- vscode-icons: if you want your VSCode icons to look the same as mine.
- Thunder Client / Postman: we will introduce these ones on week 4.
- VS Code ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets (optional): we can use this one from week 6 onwards.
- Tailwind Fold: this one will be useful from week 8.
- Total TypeScript: this one will be useful from week 9.
- Docker: we will use this one on week 11.

I do recommend you find a VSCode theme that works better for you. I will be using Shades of Purple during the course.
